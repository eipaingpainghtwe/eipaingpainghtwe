## 👋 Hi there and welcome to my README!

I'm **Ei Paing**, a junior at **Columbia University**, majoring in **Computer Science** and minoring in **Biology**.  
I'm an aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer** with a passion for applying AI to real-world problems in the **healthcare field**.

## 💡 About Me

Coming from an underprivileged family and country (**Myanmar**), I experienced firsthand the lack of access to proper healthcare — not just for me, but for my entire community. That reality fuels my dream: to develop **machine learning technologies** that can help **predict diseases**, such as **breast cancer**, and improve access to **early diagnosis and treatment**.

I’m currently an **AI Fellow at Break Through Tech**, a **Cornell Tech** initiative that empowers women in **ML and data science**.  
Right now, I’m focused on **building ML models** and **deepening my skills in data science**. I’m actively seeking an **internship** where I can contribute to meaningful projects and learn from industry professionals — got any leads? Let me know!
